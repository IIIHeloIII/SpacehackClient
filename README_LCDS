The LCDS now all work in hardware mode.

Configuration:
	The config for the HD44780 bus must contain pin IDs for LCD_RS and at least pins LCD_D4 to LCD_D7.
	To enable 8 bit mode on a console that supports it, all you need to do is add pin IDs for pins LCD_D0 to LCD_D3

	Here is an example HD44780 bus section with correct pin IDs for 8 bit mode on the new LCDs:
		"hd44780": {
			"LCD_RS": "P8_15",
			"LCD_D0": "P8_7",
			"LCD_D1": "P8_8",
			"LCD_D2": "P8_9",
			"LCD_D3": "P8_10",
			"LCD_D4": "P8_11",
			"LCD_D5": "P8_12",
			"LCD_D6": "P8_13",
			"LCD_D7": "P8_14"
		}

	The config for the Nokia bus must contain pin IDs for LCD_DC and LCD_RST.

	Here is an example of a Nokia bus config section with correct pin IDs for hardware SPI on the new boards.
		"Nokia": {
			"LCD_DC": "P9_15",
			"LCD_RST": "P9_12"
		}
	Note that older setups with software SPI will require pin IDs for LCD_DIN, LCD_SCLK and possibly LCD_LED.


Enable pins:

	HD44780 pins

	P8_16     -> Contrast selector A

	P8_17     \
	P8_18      \
	P8_19       > contrast selector B - E
	P8_27     _/

	Nokia enable pins

	P9_23
	P9_24
	P9_25
