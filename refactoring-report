Summary of refactoring

	New files:
	-controls/
	|	-control_manager.py
	|
	-gamelibs/
	|	-config_manager.py
	|	-lcd_manager.py

New file gamelibs/config_manager.py loads the JSON config file for the client and provides various lists and dictionaries as results.

New file gamelibs/lcd_manager.py reads the configuration passed to it and initialises the LCDs returning an instance of the LcdManager class.

New file controls/control_manager.py defines the abstract class SHControl and contains definitions for all diferent control types. Each control has methods poll(), processValueAssignment() and processRoundConfig().
TODO Each control definition should be in a different file to make it safer for two people to simultaneously [contemporaneously?] work on implementing different controls.

The huge if elif elif... blocks in the original game.py have been remove and all of the code for each control there is now in the control_manager.py file. As a result, game.py is now much shorter. Most of the meaningful code is in control_manager.py.
