Super Top Secret Console Game 

"Client" is the game client, which runs on Beaglebone Black and handles communications with physical hardware, and game communications with the server over MQTT.
"Server" runs on a Raspberry Pi and handles running the game, control text generation and sound effects as well as hosting the game's MQTT broker.

"ProofOfConcept" tested proposed candidate infrastructure to prove the concept was workable on Beaglebone and Raspberry Pi.
