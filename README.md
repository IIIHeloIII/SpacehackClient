Super Top Secret Console Game

"ProofOfConcept" tests proposed candidate infrastructure and consists of two projects:
* "Game" - runs on Beaglebone Black, demos MQTT subscription-based control updating,
* "Gameserver" - runs on Raspberry Pi, with Mosquitto installed locally.  Also includes control text generation.

Since the game client runs on very specific hardware that's currently in my house, it might be tricky to experiment with it directly.  But the server code is much more independent, and only really expects a Mosquitto server running locally and the Mosquitto Python library installed by Pip.  It doesn't yet even have any Pi-specific features so you could get the game server code running on any computer you like and try hacking together your own client code that subscribes to the MQTT topics and displays the data being generated by the server code.
